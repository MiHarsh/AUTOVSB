## About the project 

### Description  :
A script based on browser automation which continuously scraps COVID-19 vaccine slot data, alerts you and books it for you when it's available using cowin-public-v2 API for India.

### Features : 
-   A secure script for automatic vaccine slot booking.
-   Vizualisable and easy-to-use, browser automation.
-   Auto alert on slots availability.
-   Supports multiple pincodes, Increased chances of booking.
-   Automatic appointment slip downloading. 

### Build With : 
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) - used for browser automation.

### Motivation:
I am a Bachelor's student, due to having irregular schedules, we often face many troubles. Booking a vaccine slot now stands on the top ;) Many of my friends were facing the same problem, sometimes looking for slots also hindered the efficiency of doing other tasks. Occasionally, we also kept an eye on the telegram groups. Getting fed up with this, we thought of finding a solution.

So, Who are we? We are programmers. What do we do? We write codes ;) Why not have one for this problem too? And here's the solution.

**I had recently learned puppeteer, a super cool browser automation library. So this project is mainly based on puppeteer.**
